    "- Approach 1 is straightforward. You can use $10^6$ samples to get a reasonably accurate estimate of $\\bar f$ and from this an estimate for the integral, but DO NOT PLOT THE SAMPLES! Report the value of the integral and produce a plot showing $y = f(x)$ and a rectangular box $[a,b] \\times [0,\\bar f]$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Approach 2 requires Monte Carlo samples in a rectangular region $[a,b] \\times [y_{min}, y_{max}]$, where $y_{min}$ and $y_{max}$ should be such as to contain the graph $y = f(x)$, but not too much larger. The graph partitions the rectangle into three types of regions - those that contribute positively to the integral, those that contributed negatively to the integral, and those that do not contribute. From the areas, estimate the integral and report the value. For a sample size of $N=2000$ (NOT LARGER!) produce a plot showing the Monte Carlo points coloured according to the type of region they are in. There should be three colours. Include on the plot the graph $y = f(x)$ and a line on the x axis. \n",

    "plays a central role in mathematical finance. This equation describes what is known as [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion).  $S(t)$ is taken to be positive and represents the value of a stock at time $t$. The deterministic ODE $\\dot S(t) = \\mu S(t)$, describes exponential growth in the value of a stock. We consider $\\mu > 0$ and refer to $\\mu$ as the growth rate. The term $\\sigma S(t) \\xi(t)$ describes fluctuations in the value of a stock. $\\xi(t)$ is a Gaussian random variable. The parameter $\\sigma > 0$ is known as the volatility. Notice that the fluctuating term contains $S(t)$ itself. This models the fact that fluctuations in a stock price are proportional to the price. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time $t$ is measured in years. Typical values for $\\mu$ are between $0.01$ and $0.10$, corresponding to 1% and 10% annual growth (non-compounded). We assume values for $\\sigma$ are between $0.1$ and $0.4$. \n",

    "- Implementation:\n",
    "    - You must write a function `SDE_GBM(S0, tf, mu, sigma, Npaths)` that compute `Npaths` paths of the SDE and returns `t, S`. The function should not plot the results.\n",
    "    - `Nsteps` is not included as an argument to the function. `Nsteps` should be set to `365 * tf` corresponding to a time step of 1 day. (In practice it is common to use the number of trading days in a year, but we will use 365.)\n",
    "    - The implementation is a straightforward generalisation of the example SDEs in the Week 6 notebooks. Copy and modify those examples as needed. You need to include $S$ in the fluctuating term, but still use $\\sqrt{\\Delta t}$ as usual. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameters:\n",
    "    - Use a final time of $t_f = 5$, corresponding to 5 years. \n",
    "    - Decide the values you want to use for the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ consistent with the discussion above.\n",
    "    - Take the initial stock price to be $S_0 = 100$. \n",

    "    - Plot `Npaths=100` sample paths $S(t)$. \n",
    "    - Now call your function with `Npaths = 2000`. Make a plot showing the mean +/- standard deviation for the 2000 paths as a function of time, as discussed in the Week 6 notebooks.\n",
    "    - With the same data as the previous item, plot histograms at three times, one of which should be the final time. (You might not want equally spaced times.) Either plot all three histograms on the same plot, or else in three plots all with the same limits on all plots (so that they can be compared). Print the mean and standard deviation for each of the histograms. \n",
