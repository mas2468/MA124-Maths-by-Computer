# MA124-Maths-by-Computer

This repository contains all the work I did as part of a module in my first year of university, called Maths by Computer. The module's learning objectives were to use python to solve problems in a variety of different mathematical situations and to generally increase coding competency. I completed 5 assignments for this module and in each assignment folder you will find a pdf of the handout we were given which detailed the tasks to carry out (aside from Assignment 5 which was a notebook with the tasks included and we had to fill it out) and various jupyter notebooks (in the form of ipynb files) being what I created as part of the assignment - a template, a version to hand in, a corrected version, solutions or some where they are split into parts. In some, you will also find accompanying files like screenshots of things related to the assignment, data sets we used or something else.
