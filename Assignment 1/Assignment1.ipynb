    "Note that for a given $N$, there are $N+1$ terms of the sine series and the highest power of $x$ is $x^{2N+1}$, while there are $N$ terms for the $\\ln(1+x)$ series and the highest power is $x^{N}$. \n",

Each function should have two arguments: `x` and `N`, where `x` is an np.array and `N` is an integer. The functions should return an np.array with the series approximation evaluated at `x`. \n",

    "For both plots you will want to play with line weights, styles and/or colours to distinguish the true functions and approximate curves. You will also need to adjust the vertical plot limits to have informative plots. You may plot a grid or not as you think best. You are **not required to include a legend**. You can assume that the reader can understand the ordering of the curves with $N$ from their behaviour."

For the purposes of this question, a roller coaster is a closed, embedded (non-self-intersecting) curve in $\\mathbb R^3$, that has one \"fun feature\". These roller coasters do not have to make mechanical sense. For example, they can have sharp corners. However, they must be closed so that the passengers can get off where they got on. They cannot self-intersect for passenger safety. \n",

There can be at most one straight section. One section must be a \"fun feature\", meaning that it looks fun, so at a minimum this section does not lie in a plane. \n",

Since you are required to print the first and last points of each segment, it will be obvious from the output when sections to line up end to end. Continue to work section by section and make sure the end point of the last section matches the first point of the first section. \n",

Consider [this sketch of a chair](http://chairnotes.blogspot.com/2007/10/drawing.html) and Google \"orthographic views\". You may explore making 3D plots in Python. However, for consistency in the submissions, you should only submit 2D plots. \n",
